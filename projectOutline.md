Perfect. 🔥 That’s actually the *best* way to teach JS to a beginner — start from something real, break down *what features require what concepts*, and then build those concepts just-in-time. That keeps motivation high and avoids teaching theory that doesn’t yet “click”.

Let’s do this in 3 clean steps 👇

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Pick a simple but realistic app idea

We want something that:

* Is visually rewarding
* Involves DOM + events + basic data (arrays/objects)
* Can slowly evolve from beginner → intermediate
* Can be completed in small feature increments

Here are **3 good candidates**:

### Option A — **Task / Todo App**

* Add, delete, edit, mark done, filter tasks
* Later add: LocalStorage, search, date/time, API sync

### Option B — **Expense Tracker**

* Add expenses (item + amount)
* Show total, delete entries
* Later add: category filters, charts, localStorage, monthly summary

### Option C — **Student Manager**

* Add student name + marks
* Show pass/fail (using `if`)
* Calculate average, filter toppers, localStorage

---

## ⚙️ Step 2 — Example breakdown (let’s take **Todo App**)

We’ll reverse-engineer what **concepts** are needed for each feature.

| Feature                                     | Concepts needed                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Add a new task via input box and button | `DOM`, `event listeners`, `functions`, `if` checks, `appendChild` |
| 2️⃣ Show list of tasks dynamically          | `arrays`, `loops`, `innerHTML`, `forEach`                         |
| 3️⃣ Delete a task                           | `event.target`, `parentElement`, `array.splice()`                 |
| 4️⃣ Mark as done                            | `classList.toggle()`, `event delegation`                          |
| 5️⃣ Edit a task                             | `prompt()`, updating arrays, re-rendering DOM                     |
| 6️⃣ Save tasks in LocalStorage              | `JSON.stringify`, `localStorage`, `JSON.parse`                    |
| 7️⃣ Filter tasks (All / Done / Pending)     | `array.filter`, `buttons`, conditionals                           |
| 8️⃣ Add due date                            | `Date`, sorting, template literals                                |
| 9️⃣ Sync with fake API                      | `fetch`, `async/await`, error handling                            |

Now you have a **feature-based curriculum**, not theory-based.

---

## 🧱 Step 3 — Turn that into a “teaching ladder”

You start by designing the *app skeleton* — a static HTML layout with:

* Input box
* Add button
* Empty `<ul>` to hold tasks

Then, as each new feature comes, you teach the relevant concept.

Here’s the **progressive roadmap** for that Todo App:

---

### 🧩 Phase 1: Make it work (core JS + DOM)

**Target:** Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Delete)

| Session | Feature                        | Concepts                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Add new task                   | Event listeners, `value`, `createElement`, `appendChild` |
| 2       | Display tasks list dynamically | Arrays, Loops                                            |
| 3       | Delete task                    | DOM traversal, array manipulation                        |
| 4       | Mark task done                 | Class toggling, conditionals                             |

---

### 💾 Phase 2: Make it smart

**Target:** Data persistence + filtering

| Session | Feature                | Concepts                         |
| ------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 5       | Save tasks permanently | LocalStorage, JSON, functions    |
| 6       | Filter Done / Pending  | Filter, array methods            |
| 7       | Edit task              | Object mutation, re-render logic |

---

### 🌐 Phase 3: Make it connected

**Target:** Add data fetching + async logic

| Session | Feature                           | Concepts                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 8       | Load initial tasks from JSON file | `fetch`, `then`, `async/await` |
| 9       | Handle errors + empty states      | Promises, error handling       |
| 10      | Refactor into functions           | Modular thinking, debugging    |

---

### 🧠 Phase 4: Polish and extend

**Target:** UX and ES6 practice

| Session | Feature                         | Concepts                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 11      | Sorting by date                 | Array `sort`, Date object           |
| 12      | Arrow functions + destructuring | ES6 refresh                         |
| 13      | Theming (light/dark mode)       | DOM class toggling, CSS integration |

---

## 🎯 End Result

By the end of this track, she’ll have:

* Learned ~80% of core JS & DOM needed for real work
* Understood concepts in *context* of features
* Built a functioning app she can proudly show off

---

If you like this approach, I can now:

1. Pick **one app idea** (say Todo or Expense Tracker)
2. Write a **complete teaching roadmap** (sessions, outcomes, exercises, mini homeworks)
3. Include short code stubs and DOM skeleton for each feature

Which app do you want to build the syllabus around —
**Todo**, **Expense Tracker**, or **Student Manager**?
